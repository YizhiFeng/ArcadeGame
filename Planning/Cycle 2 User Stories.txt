Cycle 2:
Up to this stage, we figured out the right path to proceed the project. Jizhong and I were
   responsible for handling the behavior of mushrooms in terms of contacting with bullets, 
   hero and centipede, and keeping any ojects from moving outside the map. Zhihong was 
   responsible for creating centipede and allowing it to run in the classic motion. Then we 
   gathered up and completed the handling reaction among all the objects that we have so 
   far. Zhihong came up a good way to improving the calling in the KeyboardListener to
   make the hero move much more smoothly than before. Then we all discussed and worked
   to decrease as many duplications as we could.
I found that the whole team keeps coopreating better and better. Zhihong is really good at
   coding and the other two are good at keep track of what we are doing. This is a good 
   momentum for us to proceed the project. We are really confident that we can finish the 
   project with good animations and awesome addtional features.

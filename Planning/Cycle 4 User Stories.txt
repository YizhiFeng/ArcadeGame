Cycle 4:
On the last cycle, we added a few extra features in the game such as background music and level 4 of weapon.
    Jizhou succeeded in finishing all the features of the weapon. Zhihong re-organized the threading in game 
    class, creating a separate thread for Centipede so that Centipede moves much more smoothly and player can
    avoid possible concurrent runtime error. I added two new JPanel to the frame so that player can easily
    understand the rules and instruction by reading on the side of the frame. Another panel demonstrates the top
    15 scores in history and can update when a new top scores.
At the end, we formatted all the class and added comment and java docs for all the function. We re-arranged the
    order of the called methods so that they are shown step by step and can be understood more easily. Overall,
    we think that we completed our project as well as we expected. We are satisfield that we kept working together
    with continuous discussion on all the setups throughout the project.
We did it!

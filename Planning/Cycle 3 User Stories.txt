Cycle 3:
Cycle 3 turns out to be the most productive time period for our project. Every member adds a lot more 
    features on the game and comes up many great ideas on how we should demonstrate the characteristics
    of the new itmes. Zhihong takes the responsibility to add the Flea, Scorpion and poisoned mushroom
    to the game; Jizhou brings up the idea that hero can upgrade its weapon by contacting with Buff, and he
    finishes implementing it; I create a ScoreBoard on the top of the frame so that the player can easily know 
    the current state of the game while playing, in addition to the "blinking" style of the font. 
We are so happy that we have made a huge progress on our report. Everyone in the group works on what he
    is good at, while everyone gives opinion and takes suggestions from each other. In the next and final cycle,
    Jizhou will continue on implementing more features of the weapon; I will try to make the instruction of 
    the game show up on the sides of the frame; and Zhihong will, as usual, improve the quality of the written 
    codes and make better graphics for the game.

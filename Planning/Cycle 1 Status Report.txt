Stage 1:
We finished theCircle 1 as the requirement. The procedure is mainly divided to three parts.
Firstly we figure out the classes and fuctions we need to use to implement stage1. Then we started working 
on how to make mushroom and heros show on the graph. 
Then I set up the frame. Zhihong Zhai figures out how to addicons to the GUI. Yizhi Feng works on the arrays 
which need to store. This part of job should credits more to Zhihong Zhai and Yizhi Feng who give the team
 a good start!
 Then we refine the program. We also add the bullet class into the gameobject which is the abstract class for 
 all the object shows on 
the frame. Zhihong Zhai makes bullet move in the right direction. Yizhi Feng makes the bullet shoot out from
the center of the hero. I add the change level and levelreader.

Totally we use about 7 hours to finish the stage 1.
